## Course description ##

Welcome to Data 101! This course provides an introduction to the core ideas of data science from a humanities and social sciences perspective. Topics include data visualization, data wrangling, statistical measures of center, spread, and position, modeling, text analysis, extracting data from images, spatial analysis. Upon successful completion of the course a student will be able to
* Formulate and/or analyze complex questions that can be addressed with numbers, symbols, or data.
* Evaluate and interpret relevant quantitative information to support an argument.
* Interpret and translate between multiple representations of quantitative information.
* Analyze and interpret data using visualization techniques and statistical summaries.
* Learn how models are built, trained, and used to make sense of real-world systems.

We will make extensive use of the Python and Jupyter Notebook to generate graphical and numerical representations of data, and apply basic modeling techniques while we interpret the results. Python is a fun and useful computational tool as well as an immediate resume builder!
